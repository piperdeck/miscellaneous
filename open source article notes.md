Feedback from the working group
- The jump from the intro to the first content section is pretty sudden.
- It might not be necessary to talk about patents and trademarks
- Maybe this should be broken into two articles?

The case against CLAs
=====

- Contribution to open source is supposed to be frictionless, and CLAs reintroduce that friction. Needing to sign a CLA creates a bureaucratic hurdle to be overcome before you can start contributing.
- It also creates a power imbalance between the maintainer of the project and contributors to the project.
